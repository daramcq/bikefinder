Hacks/Hackers Workshop
Insight@NUIG

Host: Digital Humanities and Journalism Group

Overview

10.30->12.00: Setup, print, variables, lists, dictionaries, for loop
12.00->13.00 Lunch
13.00->14.30: Methods, APIs, If/Else, Students writing new methods 
14.30->15.00 Break
15.00->16.30: Configuration and help with future resources


Session 1

10.30 -> 11.00: Introduction - Describe overall aim. Begin with set up.

11.00 -> 11.30: Printing with console, variables

11.30 -> 12.00 Data types and data structures - using console to define and manipulate lists and dictionaries. Explain 'For' loop.

12.00 -> 13.00: Lunch Break


Session 2

13.00 -> 13.30: Begin project: Write steps in pseudo-code. Use Browser to make request from CityBikes API. Explain JSON.

13.30 -> 14.00: Explain methods, ask students to write a simple method in a file.

14.00 -> 14.30: Explain If/Else, test in Console. Ask students to try writing a method that will take the list of stations and return the names of all stations with an available bike.


14.30 -> 15.00: Break


Session 3

15.00 -> 16.00: If there is time, write in Pseudo-Code how to get closest station (assuming getDistance is defined already)

16.00 -> 16.30: Discuss code completion and try using it, point to additional resources
