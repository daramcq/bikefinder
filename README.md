### Overview

10.30->12.00: Setup, print, variables, lists, dictionaries, for loop
12.00->13.00 Lunch
13.00->14.30: Methods, APIs, If/Else, Students writing new methods 
14.30->15.00 Break
15.00->16.30: Configuration and help with future resources


### Session 1

__10.30 -> 11.00__: Introduction - Describe overall aim. Begin with set up.

__11.00 -> 11.30__: Printing with console, variables

__11.30 -> 12.00:__ Data types and data structures - using console to define and manipulate lists and dictionaries. Explain 'For' loop.

__12.00 -> 13.00:__ Lunch Break


### Session 2

__13.00 -> 13.30:__ Begin project: Write steps in pseudo-code. Use Browser to make request from CityBikes API. Explain JSON.

__13.30 -> 14.00:__ Explain methods, ask students to write a simple method in a file.

__14.00 -> 14.30:__ Explain If/Else, test in Console. Ask students to try writing a method that will take the list of stations and return the names of all stations with an available bike.

__14.30 -> 15.00:__ Break


### Session 3

__15.00 -> 16.00:__ If there is time, write in Pseudo-Code how to get closest station (assuming getDistance is defined already)

__16.00 -> 16.30:__ Discuss code completion and try using it, point to additional resources
